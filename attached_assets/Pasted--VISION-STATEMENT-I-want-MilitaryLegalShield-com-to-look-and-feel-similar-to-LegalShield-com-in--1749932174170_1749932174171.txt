 VISION STATEMENT:
 "I want MilitaryLegalShield.com to look and feel similar to LegalShield.com in terms of design, layout, and
 user experience-but fully tailored to serve the six branches of the U.S. military, veterans, and their families.
 The goal is to create a near mirror image in functionality and polish, but with a military-first focus that reflects
 the needs, language, and culture of our service members. The result should not only match LegalShield's
 user interface but exceed it in relevance, simplicity, and trust for the military community."
