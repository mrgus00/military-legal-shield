 MilitaryLegalShield.com is a freemium legal support platform designed for service members. The site must
 clearly distinguish between free and premium features, function seamlessly on all devices, and be optimized
 for search engines. It must also fully integrate with Stripe for payment processing.
 CORE OBJECTIVES:
 1. Align all features with freemium standards.
 2. Ensure complete Stripe integration for premium access.
 3. Optimize all components for mobile and SEO.
 4. Deliver a smooth, responsive user experience across all platforms.

 Free Features:- Legal FAQs- Blog or resource center- Intro articles- Newsletter sign-up- Basic contact form
 Premium Features:- 1-on-1 legal consults- POA and document support- Attorney database access- Priority legal support- Case tracking dashboard
Action: All premium content must trigger upgrade/payment flows.

 UI/UX REQUIREMENTS:- Clear differentiation between free and premium- Locked content visuals and tooltips- Clear CTAs for sign-up and upgrade- Fully responsive design (desktop/mobile/tablet)
 MOBILE OPTIMIZATION & SEO:- Ensure full mobile responsiveness- Link all phone numbers for click-to-call- Link all emails for tap-to-email- Implement on-page SEO (meta tags, keywords, alt text)- Use high-quality backlinks for domain authority- Fast loading speeds (under 3 seconds)
 QA & MOBILE OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST:
 User Feedback:- The app is currently not functioning well on mobile devices.- Banners and key content are running off-screen, causing layout issues.- This makes the app feel clunky and inconsistent with user expectations.
 Action Items:
- Conduct a full mobile optimization audit.- Ensure all banners, buttons, and content elements are responsive and properly scaled on all screen sizes.- Use flexbox or grid-based layouts for adaptive content rendering.- Verify no horizontal scrolling is necessary on mobile views.- Optimize image and banner scaling within container limits.- Test across multiple devices (iOS/Android) and browsers.
 Goal:- The app should function smoothly and intuitively, with performance and usability comparable to LegalShield,
 while being fully tailored to military service members across all branches
